// Package stellar fetches deployed contract code from a Stellar network.

// Reading a contract's WASM takes two RPC round trips. The contract's
// instance ledger entry holds an executable that names the WASM by hash;
// that hash is then the key of the contract code entry holding the bytes
// themselves. Callers that only need to know whether a contract has changed
// can stop after the first trip by calling WasmHash.
