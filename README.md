# SoroVault

A contract metadata and interface (ABI) registry for the Stellar/Soroban network.

SoroVault fetches a deployed contract's WASM, decodes the interface embedded in
it, stores it, and serves a searchable registry — so tools and humans can
discover what functions and types a contract exposes.

**Status:** MVP. The core is complete and tested; see [open ground](#open-ground)
for where contributions are most welcome.

---

## Why

A deployed Soroban contract is a black box unless you have its interface.

The interface is right there in the uploaded WASM — Soroban embeds it as a
`contractspecv0` custom section — but getting at it means knowing which ledger
entries to read, how to walk a WASM binary, and how to decode a stream of XDR.
Every tool that wants to know what a contract does re-implements that.

SoroVault does it once and serves the result as clean JSON:

```console
$ curl -s localhost:8080/api/contracts/CDZZ…4PAN | jq '.interface.functions[].name'
"vote"
"has_voted"
"initialize"
"get_proposal"
"get_total_votes"
"get_vote_params"
"get_proposal_count"
```

It is the discovery layer for contract interfaces, and the natural companion to
a deployer (SoroForge) and a simulator (SoroProbe).

## What it does

- **Register** a contract by ID — fetch its WASM, decode the interface, store it
- **Search** the registry by contract ID or name
- **Serve** the decoded ABI as JSON: functions, arguments, return types, UDTs, events
- **Version** interfaces — when a contract is upgraded, the prior interface is kept
- **Browse** it all in a small server-rendered UI

Records are namespaced by network, so the same contract ID on testnet and
mainnet are separate entries.

## Verified against

Contract spec handling evolves, so these were confirmed against live sources
rather than recalled. Verified **2026-08-07**:

| | Version | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Go | **1.25** | required by the SDK; `go.mod` pins `1.25.0` |
| [`github.com/stellar/go-stellar-sdk`](https://github.com/stellar/go-stellar-sdk) | **v0.7.1** | RPC client and XDR |
| Stellar RPC (testnet) | 27.1.1, protocol 27 | endpoint the decode path was exercised against |
| soroban-sdk (test fixture) | 25.3.0 | the contract in `internal/spec/testdata` |
| [SEP-48](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0048.md) | 1.1.0 | contract interface specification |

> **On the SDK:** the original plan named `github.com/stellar/go`. That module is
> now formally deprecated — its `go.mod` carries
> `// Deprecated: Use github.com/stellar/go-stellar-sdk instead` — so SoroVault
> builds against the successor. This is also why the Go floor is 1.25 rather
> than the 1.22 originally targeted: the new SDK requires it.

### How the interface is actually retrieved

Worth writing down, because it is the part that is easy to get wrong:

1. **Contract instance.** Build a `LedgerKey` for `ContractData` with the
   contract's `ScAddress`, the key `ScvLedgerKeyContractInstance`, and
   `Persistent` durability. `getLedgerEntries` returns a `ContractDataEntry`
   whose `Val.Instance.Executable.WasmHash` names the module.
   - A Stellar asset contract has no `WasmHash` — it is built into the host, so
     there is no interface to decode. SoroVault reports this distinctly.
2. **Contract code.** Build a `LedgerKey` for `ContractCode` keyed by that hash.
   `getLedgerEntries` returns a `ContractCodeEntry` holding the module bytes.
   The hash is the SHA-256 of the module, which is what makes it a usable
   version identifier.
3. **Spec section.** Walk the WASM's section framing for the custom section
   named `contractspecv0`.
4. **Decode.** Its body is a **bare stream of XDR-encoded `SCSpecEntry` values**
   — no header, no delimiter, no length prefix between entries. Read it by
   calling `xdr.Unmarshal` in a loop until the reader is drained.
5. **Metadata.** The optional `contractmetav0` section holds `SCMetaEntry`
   key/value pairs (`rsver`, `rssdkver`). Its absence is not an error.

The SDK does not parse WASM custom sections, so `internal/wasm` implements the
small amount of the binary format that step 3 needs.

## Quickstart

The fastest path is Docker, which brings up Postgres, applies migrations and
starts the server:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/soroworks/sorovault && cd sorovault
$ make up
```

Then register a contract and browse it:

```console
$ curl -X POST localhost:8080/api/contracts \
    -H 'content-type: application/json' \
    -d '{"contract_id":"CDZZXVGUCLBUTE3WDD6TF2NXPTBPOYTVPPBBIZMSPVIQLUG226XJ4PAN"}'
```

Open <http://localhost:8080> for the browse UI.

### Running locally

```console
$ cp .env.example .env          # adjust as needed
$ set -a && source .env && set +a

$ docker compose up -d db       # or point DATABASE_URL at your own Postgres
$ go run ./cmd/sorovault migrate
$ go run ./cmd/sorovault add CDZZXVGUCLBUTE3WDD6TF2NXPTBPOYTVPPBBIZMSPVIQLUG226XJ4PAN
$ go run ./cmd/sorovault serve
```

## Configuration

All configuration is environment variables. Only `DATABASE_URL` is required.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | — | Postgres connection string. **Required.** |
| `RPC_URL` | `https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org` | Stellar RPC endpoint |
| `NETWORK_PASSPHRASE` | `Test SDF Network ; September 2015` | the network you expect `RPC_URL` to serve |
| `HTTP_ADDR` | `:8080` | listen address |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error` |
| `RPC_TIMEOUT` | `30s` | bound on a single contract fetch |
| `REFRESH_INTERVAL` | `0` (off) | re-check registered contracts this often while serving; minimum `1m` |

`NETWORK_PASSPHRASE` is a guard, not a source of truth. SoroVault reads the real
passphrase from the RPC endpoint and refuses to proceed if the two disagree, so
a stale `RPC_URL` cannot quietly file mainnet contracts under `testnet`.

### Automatic refresh

Set `REFRESH_INTERVAL` (for example `6h`) and `sorovault serve` re-checks, on
that schedule, every contract on its network that has not been refreshed
within the interval. An upgraded contract gets a new interface version
exactly as `POST /api/contracts/{id}/refresh` would record it; an unchanged
one costs a single `getLedgerEntries` call and is not re-downloaded.

A contract that fails to refresh — expired, or an RPC error — is logged and
skipped, and the sweep carries on. One sweep runs at startup and then one per
interval; a sweep in progress at shutdown is cancelled before the database is
closed.

## HTTP API

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/contracts` | list contracts — `?q=`, `?network=`, `?limit=`, `?offset=` |
| `POST` | `/api/contracts` | register a contract — `{"contract_id": "C…"}` |
| `GET` | `/api/contracts/{id}` | the decoded ABI — `?network=`, `?wasm_hash=` |
| `GET` | `/api/contracts/{id}/functions/{fn}` | one function in detail |
| `GET` | `/api/contracts/{id}/versions` | every stored interface version |
| `POST` | `/api/contracts/{id}/refresh` | re-check against the network |
| `GET` | `/healthz` | liveness |

`POST /api/contracts` returns **201** when the contract is new and **200** when
it was already registered, so it is safe to retry. Passing `?wasm_hash=` to a
read selects a superseded version instead of the current one.

Status codes worth knowing: **422** means the contract exists but has no
interface to serve (a Stellar asset contract, or a module with no spec section),
as distinct from **404**, which means it is not there at all.

## CLI

```console
sorovault add <contract_id>...      # fetch, decode and register
sorovault refresh <contract_id>...  # re-check for an upgraded interface
sorovault list                      # -q, --network, --limit, --offset
sorovault get <contract_id>         # --function, --wasm-hash, --json
sorovault serve                     # JSON API + browse UI
sorovault migrate                   # apply schema migrations
```

`add` and `refresh` accept several contract IDs and report per-contract
failures without abandoning the rest. Every read command takes `--json`, which
emits exactly what the API serves:

```console
$ sorovault get CDZZ…4PAN --function has_voted
fn has_voted(nullifier: BytesN<32>) -> bool

inputs:
  nullifier  BytesN<32>

returns: bool
```

## The ABI JSON

This is the project's public contract — the shape other tooling should build
against. `abi_version` is bumped if it ever changes incompatibly.

```jsonc
{
  "abi_version": "1",
  "meta": { "rsver": "1.93.0-nightly", "rssdkver": "25.3.0#dcbea445…" },

  "functions": [
    {
      "name": "vote",
      "doc": "Cast a vote using a ZK Firma Digital Groth16 proof.…",
      "inputs": [
        { "name": "voter",       "type": { "kind": "address", "display": "Address" } },
        { "name": "pub_signals", "type": { "kind": "vec", "display": "Vec<BytesN<32>>",
                                           "element": { "kind": "bytes_n", "display": "BytesN<32>", "n": 32 } } }
      ],
      "outputs": [
        { "kind": "result", "display": "Result<(), Error>",
          "ok":    { "kind": "void",  "display": "()" },
          "error": { "kind": "error", "display": "Error" } }
      ]
    }
  ],

  "types": {
    "structs":     [ { "name": "Proposal", "fields": [ … ], "is_tuple": false } ],
    "unions":      [ { "name": "DataKey",  "cases":  [ { "name": "Admin", "values": [] } ] } ],
    "enums":       [ { "name": "Status",   "cases":  [ { "name": "Active", "value": 0 } ] } ],
    "error_enums": [ { "name": "Error",    "cases":  [ { "name": "AlreadyVoted", "value": 5 } ] } ]
  },

  "events": [
    {
      "name": "Voted",
      "prefix_topics": ["voted"],
      "params": [
        { "name": "voter",          "type": { "kind": "address", "display": "Address" }, "location": "topic-list" },
        { "name": "proposal_index", "type": { "kind": "u32",     "display": "u32"     }, "location": "data" }
      ],
      "data_format": "map"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Types

Every type is an object with a `kind` and a `display`. `display` is the
human-readable rendering of the whole type (`"Option<Vec<u32>>"`) so that UIs
and documentation generators do not each have to re-implement the traversal.

**Scalars** — `val`, `bool`, `void`, `error`, `u32`, `i32`, `u64`, `i64`,
`timepoint`, `duration`, `u128`, `i128`, `u256`, `i256`, `bytes`, `string`,
`symbol`, `address`, `muxed_address`. These carry no extra fields.

**Containers** — each adds the fields it needs:

| `kind` | Extra fields |
|---|---|
| `option` | `inner` |
| `vec` | `element` |
| `map` | `key`, `value` |
| `result` | `ok`, `error` |
| `tuple` | `elements` (array) |
| `bytes_n` | `n` |
| `udt` | `name` — refers to an entry in `types` |

A few things worth relying on:

- `outputs` is an array, but Soroban allows at most one entry. **Empty means the
  function returns nothing.**
- Empty collections are `[]`, never `null`, so you can iterate without a check.
- `is_tuple` on a struct marks a Rust tuple struct, which Soroban encodes as a
  struct whose fields are named `"0"`, `"1"`, … — flagged so consumers need not
  re-derive it.
- `meta` is omitted entirely when a contract carries no metadata section.

## How it fits together

```
cmd/sorovault      cobra CLI; also serves the API and UI
internal/config    environment configuration
internal/model     the ABI model — no dependencies, the public JSON contract
internal/wasm      WASM custom-section reader
internal/spec      contract spec decoding: XDR -> model
internal/stellar   RPC client and contract fetch
internal/store     Postgres registry, migrations, and an in-memory store
internal/registry  register/refresh orchestration
internal/refresher scheduled re-checks of registered contracts
internal/api       chi JSON handlers
internal/web       html/template + htmx browse UI
```

Three seams are interfaces, and each one is the natural place to extend the
project: **`stellar.Fetcher`** (where contract code comes from),
**`spec.Decoder`** (how an interface is derived), and **`store.Store`** (where
the registry lives). Nothing above a seam depends on what is below it, which is
why the whole stack can be tested without a network or a database.

### Data model

```
contracts (network, contract_id)  PK
  current_wasm_hash, name, first_seen, last_refreshed

specs     (network, contract_id, wasm_hash)  UNIQUE
  spec jsonb, decoded_at
```

Refreshing an upgraded contract **appends** a `specs` row and repoints
`current_wasm_hash`. Prior versions are never overwritten, so an interface that
was live at some point stays retrievable by its hash.

## Development

```console
$ make test        # no database, no network needed
$ make test-all    # also runs the store suite against a throwaway Postgres
$ make lint
$ make build
$ make help        # everything else
```

`go test ./...` **never touches the network.** The decode path is exercised
against a real testnet contract checked in at
[`internal/spec/testdata/zkvote.wasm`](internal/spec/testdata/) — its provenance
and a hash check are documented alongside it. Layers above `internal/stellar`
run against a fake network (`internal/stellar/stellartest`).

The Postgres store suite skips unless `TEST_DATABASE_URL` is set; `make
test-all` and CI both set it. Both store implementations run the **same
conformance suite**, so the in-memory one other packages test against cannot
drift from the real one.

## Open ground

Contributions welcome. Deliberately **not** built yet:

- **SDK / client codegen from the ABI.** The registry already serves everything
  a generator needs — types are recursive and fully resolved, and UDT
  references are by name. Generating typed Go, TypeScript or Python clients
  from `GET /api/contracts/{id}` is the single highest-value thing to build on
  top of SoroVault, and a great first substantial contribution.
- **Resolving contract names.** The schema carries a `name`, but nothing
  populates it yet.
- **Full-text search.** Search is a substring match on ID and name. Searching
  across function and type names would mean indexing the stored jsonb.

Explicitly out of scope: authentication, and any write operation against
contracts themselves. SoroVault reads chain state; it never sends a transaction.
